Program Usage:

./hw1 \<image> [-a]

-a: save animation ('-a' could actually be any string)

1. Click and drag to rotate
2. While holding shift, click and drag to scale image
3. **While holding 'z', click and drag to translate image**
4. Use '1', '2', '3', and '4' to switch between points, lines, triangles, and smooth triangles mode
5. When in smooth triangles mode, use '9', '0', '-', and '+' to scale and exponentiate the color and height of the heightmap field.

To animate, pass in a third command line argument (any string). Animation frames are then saved in hw1/animation.

This was a pretty cool assignment! Hope u enjoy the animation :)
